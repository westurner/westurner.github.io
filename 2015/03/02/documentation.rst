Documentation
=============


This weekend, I managed to get a fixed navigation bar configured
with the `Bootstrap affix JS <http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#affix>`__
and a fair amount of CSS iteration
for Sphinx (with the excellent `sphinxjp.themes.basicstrap 
<https://github.com/tell-k/sphinxjp.themes.basicstrap>`__); 
and have been merging the new styles into various
sets of docs that I've been working on:
